Advent of Code 2022 playtime

I will tend to wait a few hours before pushing my commits here,
to avoid undue spoilers (and because I may not get around to it).
Filenames may also help you avoid reading things you didn't want to read yet.

I'm also not starting every puzzle as soon as it comes out, this year.

Some days may feature good code; other days, I will clean up not at all.

Enjoy!
