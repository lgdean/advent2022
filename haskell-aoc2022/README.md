To solve everything: `stack test` -- which, later in the month, may start to take a while!

To solve just one day: `stack test --ta='-m Day01'`

I recall that last year I had a more concise way to run tests for just one day/file,
but I no longer recall how to do it. Perhaps I'll learn along the way.
